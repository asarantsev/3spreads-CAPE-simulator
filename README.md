Simulation of stock index annual returns (nominal/real, price/total) based on trailing earnings yield and BAA-AAA, AAA-Long, Long-Short bond spreads. This extends the work in the other repository 3spreads-1yearnyield-returns covered in the blog post https://my-finance.org/2025/03/19/earnings-yield-3-bond-spreads-annual-returns/ As usual, we use annual volatility for linear regression, and we add it as another factor. The current research is covered in the post TBD.
